# phpPgAdmin

**NOTE:** The credit for this work goes to [https://github.com/jjcollinge/phppgadmin-chart](https://github.com/jjcollinge/phppgadmin-chart).
We'd prefer to use [https://github.com/jjcollinge/phppgadmin-chart](https://github.com/jjcollinge/phppgadmin-chart) directly,
but it isn't friendly with
[helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/#helm-install)
since there isn't an `index.yaml` nor a `*.tgz` file.

This is a Helm chart that deploys a phpPgAdmin instance to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

This install assumes you have an existing Kubernetes cluster installed and a [postgresql](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/postgresql) instance deployed.

## Package

Once you've cloned this repo, you can create your helm package by running the following command in the repo's root directory:

```console
helm package .
```

## Install

You now need to grab the ClusterIP of your PostgreSQL service.

```consoel
kubectl get svc
```

Filter through the list of services and grab the ClusterIP associated with your PostgreSQL service. Next you can install phpPgAdmin into your Kubernetes cluster by targeting your packaged archive:

```console
helm install --set phppgadmin.serverHost={postgresql-clusterip},phppgadmin.serverPost={postgresql-port} phppgadmin-chart-0.1.0.tgz
```

The deployment will take a little while to provision a public IP for the service. You can watch for this using the following command:

```console
kubectl get svc -w -l app=phppgadmin-chart
```

## Configure

When the deployment has finished and you have an external IP for your phpPgAdmin service, you can go to the phpPgAdmin web portal at `http://{phpPgAdmin-externalip}:8080/`.

Once web portal has loaded, you'll need to authenticate a new connection to your PostgreSQL database by clicking on the `Servers` tab.

## Ingress

The default behaviour of this helm chart is to create a new load balancer service.

If you have an ingress controller deployed and would rather use ingress, you need to enable it in the `values.yaml` file.
You will need to also provide values for hostname and configure a TLS secret or leverage Let's Encrypt using [Kube-Lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego). Once configured, change the `service.type` value to `ClusterIP`.

Assuming the `host` header is correct in your HTTP request, you can hit the external ip of the ingress controller and it should route to your phppgadmin instance.
